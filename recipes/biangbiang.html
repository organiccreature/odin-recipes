    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>My absolute obsession is spicy noodles and if you've been on social media lately you'll see the noodles that have taken the world by storm! Biang Biang noodles are thick noodles that could double as a belt. It is said that one biang biang noodle can fill an entire rice bowl (and it's true!). Learn how to make these surprisingly easy noodles - I promise, you'll be as stunned as I was as to how fun and tasty they are!</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <h3>Noodles</h3>
        <li>375g/13ozs. all purpose flour</li>
        <li>200ml/7flozs. water</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>Oil for greasing</li>
        <h3>Chilli oil</h3>
        <li>200ml/7flozs. peanut oil</li>
        <li>4 tablespoons soy sauce</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons chilli flakes</li>
        <li>1.5 tablespoon vinegar</li>
        <li>3 cloves garlic, peeled and finely diced</li>
        <li>3 sticks green shallots, finely chopped</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon cumin</li>
        <li>3 teaspoons toasted sesame seeds</li>
        <li>100g/3.5ozs. pork mince (optional)</li>
        <li>1/2 cup noodle cooking water</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Mix the flour, water and salt together until shaggy in texture. Knead until smooth and elastic (5 minutes in a mixer with a dough hook). Shape into a round and cut into 8 even pieces. Shape them into a small cucumber shape and coat in oil. Cover and rest at room temperature for 3 hours (to allow the dough to relax).</li>
        <li>Put on a large pot of water on to boil.</li>
        <li>Make the sauce-just add all ingredients in a small saucepan and heat for through until pork is cooked. If you're not using pork just heat for a minute. If you are using pork cook it until the pork is cooked through. Keep the lid on to keep it warm.</li>
        <li>Roll out all the pieces of dough on a lightly greased surface using a small greased rolling pin. You want each piece to be around 2.5-3 inches wide and a bit longer than the rolling pin. Firmly press the rolling pin against the centre vertically leaving a depression (see above).</li>
        <li>Oil your hands lightly and then gently pull it apart using the depression as a opening. It will stretch open with little prompting. Stretch it out so that it is thin, like a ribbon and a very, very long belt. Place directly into the water and cook for 1 minute or until it rises to the surface. Place in a bowl (this is enough for two bowls) and then when all the noodles are cooked, pour the hot chilli oil over it.</li>
    </ol>
